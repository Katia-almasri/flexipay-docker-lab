# 💳 FlexiPay – Custom Payment Gateway

**FlexiPay** is a scalable and secure custom payment gateway built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It acts as a central platform to process payments through various providers including **Stripe**, **PayPal**, and digital wallets. Designed with extensibility in mind, FlexiPay can be embedded in SaaS platforms or marketplaces using a platform-owned strategy, managing merchant payments and weekly balance distributions.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Multi-Provider Support** (Stripe, PayPal, digital wallets)
- 🧩 **Modular Payment Method Architecture**
- 🔐 **Secure Customer and Merchant Credential Handling**
- 📑 **Transaction Logging & Metadata Storage**
- 📊 **Pagination, Filtering, and RESTful APIs**
- 🔄 **Webhook Support** for asynchronous payment events
- 🧮 **Scheduled Payout Job** for weekly merchant balance distribution
- ⚙️ **Extensible** to add more gateways (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flexipay.git
   cd flexipay
   ```
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**

   - Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

     ```
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
     PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=***
     PAYPAL_SECRET=***
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/flexipay
     PORT=3000
     ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication

FlexiPay assumes you already have an auth system. It uses `req.user` to identify the current user (merchant or customer). You can plug in your own middleware or integrate with Passport/JWT.

---

## 🏗️ API Endpoints

### `POST /api/payments/create`

Create a new payment using selected payment method.

### `GET /api/payment-methods`

List current user's payment methods with optional filters:

```http
GET /api/payment-methods?filter[type]=stripe&filter[is_primary]=true
```

### `POST /api/payment-methods`

Add a new payment method (e.g., Stripe Customer ID, PayPal email, etc.)

### `POST /webhook/stripe`

Handles Stripe webhook events (`payment_succeeded`, `payment_failed`, etc.)

---

## ⏱️ Scheduled Payouts

A cron job runs weekly to distribute merchant balances based on accumulated transactions. This uses the `Transaction` model and aggregates balances per merchant, then initiates payouts via the payment provider API.

You can trigger it manually for testing:

```js
npm run payout:weekly
```

---

## 💡 How It Works (Stripe Example)

1. Merchant registers and adds Stripe as a payment method.
2. FlexiPay creates a Stripe customer for the user.
3. On checkout, a Stripe PaymentIntent is created.
4. Stripe handles card input + authentication.
5. On success, Stripe triggers the webhook.
6. FlexiPay updates the `Transaction` and records success.
7. Weekly, merchant balances are distributed via Stripe payouts.

## 🛡️ Best Practices Followed

- Mongoose schemas with field validation
- `.env` for all secrets and keys
- Separation of concerns (services, models, routes, jobs)
- Pagination utility with `limit`, `page`, `total`, `from`, `to`
- Map-style credentials storage (e.g., `{ customerId: "cus_abc" }`)
- Modular structure for adding future payment providers

---

## 📌 TODO / Future Features

- [ ] Add Apple Pay / Google Pay support
- [ ] Admin dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Real-time transaction tracking with WebSockets
- [ ] Merchant onboarding workflow (KYC, etc.)
- [ ] Invoicing and refund handling
