🐳 Local Docker Setup for FlexiPay
** This guide explains how to run FlexiPay locally using Docker Compose, ideal for development and testing before deploying to Docker Swarm, cloud, or production environments.**

## ⚙️ Requirements
1. Docker Engine installed

2. Docker Compose v2+ installed

3. Port 5000 (app) and 27017 (MongoDB) should be free

## 🔐 Authentication

FlexiPay assumes you already have an auth system. It uses `req.user` to identify the current user (merchant or customer). You can plug in your own middleware or integrate with Passport/JWT.

---

## 🏗️ API Endpoints

### `POST /api/payments/create`

Create a new payment using selected payment method.

### `GET /api/payment-methods`

List current user's payment methods with optional filters:

```http
GET /api/payment-methods?filter[type]=stripe&filter[is_primary]=true
```

### `POST /api/payment-methods`

Add a new payment method (e.g., Stripe Customer ID, PayPal email, etc.)

### `POST /webhook/stripe`

Handles Stripe webhook events (`payment_succeeded`, `payment_failed`, etc.)

---

## ⏱️ Scheduled Payouts

A cron job runs weekly to distribute merchant balances based on accumulated transactions. This uses the `Transaction` model and aggregates balances per merchant, then initiates payouts via the payment provider API.

You can trigger it manually for testing:

```js
npm run payout:weekly
```

---

## 💡 How It Works (Stripe Example)

1. Merchant registers and adds Stripe as a payment method.
2. FlexiPay creates a Stripe customer for the user.
3. On checkout, a Stripe PaymentIntent is created.
4. Stripe handles card input + authentication.
5. On success, Stripe triggers the webhook.
6. FlexiPay updates the `Transaction` and records success.
7. Weekly, merchant balances are distributed via Stripe payouts.

## 🛡️ Best Practices Followed

- Mongoose schemas with field validation
- `.env` for all secrets and keys
- Separation of concerns (services, models, routes, jobs)
- Pagination utility with `limit`, `page`, `total`, `from`, `to`
- Map-style credentials storage (e.g., `{ customerId: "cus_abc" }`)
- Modular structure for adding future payment providers

---

## 📌 TODO / Future Features

- [ ] Add Apple Pay / Google Pay support
- [ ] Admin dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Real-time transaction tracking with WebSockets
- [ ] Merchant onboarding workflow (KYC, etc.)
- [ ] Invoicing and refund handling

Would you like me to generate an example `.env`, a Postman collection, or include Stripe setup notes in the README?
